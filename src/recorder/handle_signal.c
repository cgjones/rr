	 * syscall, linux has exited it with an -ERESTART* error code.
	 * That means the tracee is about to (re-)enter either
	 *
	 *  1. buffered syscall
	 *  2. disarm-desched ioctl syscall
	 *
	 * We can figure out which one by simply issuing a
	 * ptrace(SYSCALL) and examining the tracee's registers.
	 *
	 * If the tracee enters the disarm-desched ioctl, it's going

	 * syscallbuf, and we can safely send the tracee back on its
	 * way, ignoring the desched completely.
	 *
	 * If it enters the buffered syscall, then the desched event
	 * has served its purpose and we need to prepare the tracee to
	 * be context-switched.
	 *
	 * An annoyance of the desched signal is that when the tracer
	 * is descheduled in interval (C) above, we see normally (see
	 * below) see *two* signals.  The current theory of what's
	 * happening is
	 *
	 *  o child gets descheduled, bumps counter to i and schedules
	 *    signal
	 *  o signal notification "schedules" child, but it doesn't
	 *    actually run any application code
	 *  o child is being ptraced, so we "deschedule" child to
	 *    notify parent and bump counter to i+1.  (The parent
	 *    hasn't had a chance to clear the counter yet.)
	 *  o another counter signal is generated, but signal is
	 *    already pending so this one is queued
	 *  o parent is notified and sees counter value i+1
	 *  o parent stops delivery of first signal and disarms
	 *    counter
	 *  o second signal dequeued and delivered, notififying parent
	 *    (counter is disarmed now, so no pseudo-desched possible
	 *    here)
	 *  o parent notifiedand sees counter value i+1 again
	 *  o parent stops delivery of second signal and we continue on
	 *
	 * So we "work around" this by the tracer expecting two signal
	 * notifications, and silently discarding both.
	 *
	 * One really fun edge case is that sometimes the desched
	 * signal will interrupt the arm-desched syscall itself.
	 * Continuing to the next syscall boundary seems to restart
	 * the arm-desched syscall, and advancing to the boundary
	 * again exits it and we start receiving desched signals
	 * again.
	 *
	 * That may be a kernel bug, but we handle it by just
	 * continuing until we we continue past the arm-desched
	 * syscall *and* stop seeing signals. */
